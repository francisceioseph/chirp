# 🐦 ChirpTalk `BETA v1.0`

**ChirpTalk** is a boutique, decentralized communication platform designed specifically for bird enthusiasts and their cockatiels. The app features a high-end **Glassmorphism** interface, delivering a fluid and sophisticated visual experience across both **Sunny Lutino** and **Wild Grey** themes.

## ✨ Design & Aesthetics

The project balances organic and industrial elements using advanced Flutter UI techniques:

* **Glassmorphism Pro:** High-fidelity panels featuring 35px `BackdropFilter` blurs and ambient occlusion borders in "Café" tones for maximum depth.
* **Dynamic Orbs:** Animated liquid spheres that float in the background, dynamically adapting color and opacity based on the active theme.
* **Lutino Palette:** A signature color scheme inspired by the Lutino cockatiel, featuring **Cheddar** for accents, **Milk** for surfaces, and **Café** for editorial-grade typography.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

ChirpTalk is built on the principles of reactivity and low coupling:

### **State Management**

Driven by the `ChirpController`, a `ChangeNotifier` that centralizes discovery logic and messaging, ensuring the UI reacts instantly via `ListenableBuilder`.

### **Network Protocol (Flock System)**

* **Discovery:** Real-time peer-to-peer advertisement and automatic discovery service for "Tiels" (network nodes).
* **Management:** Stream-based message handling and presence state management, featuring automatic cleanup of inactive members after a 15-second timeout.

### **Core Technologies**

* **Flutter & Dart 3:** Leveraging *Enhanced Enums* for connection states and *Records* for clean data handling.
* **UUID:** Universally Unique Identifiers to ensure distinct identities within the flock.
* **Animations:** Cascading entry transitions and "Heartbeat" status pulses for continuous visual feedback.
